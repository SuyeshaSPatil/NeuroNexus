Internship Tasks for NeuroNexus Innovations


Hi everyone! ðŸ‘‹

For Task 1 of the NeuroNexus Web Development Internship, I created a Google Form-style landing page using only HTML and CSS (no JavaScript).
Hereâ€™s what I did:

ðŸ”¸ I used HTML to build the structure of the form â€“ it includes fields like Full Name, Contact Number, Address, Company Name, Email, Department (dropdown), Gender (radio buttons), and a Submit button.
ðŸ”¸ I used CSS to make the form look clean and user-friendly. I added:
A different background color for the form so it stands out from the page
A subtle box shadow to give it a neat, elevated look
A hover effect on the Submit button to make it interactive
Proper spacing and alignment so everything looks well-organized

This task helped me practice basic web design and form creation using just HTML and CSS. ðŸ’»âœ¨
